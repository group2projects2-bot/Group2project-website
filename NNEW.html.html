                <p>The school bell rang loudly, and the sound reverberated throughout the school. Today marked the start of learning, making friends, and realizing our dreams. The loud bell was also the sound of laughter and footsteps of the students as they walked to the school.</p>

                <p>Initially, school was intimidating. All were <span class="highlight">seeking to see where they fit</span>. There were many new faces and many different subjects to learn. Some students were shy, and some were confident.</p>
